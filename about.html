  <h1>About Us — Daily Lift</h1>

  <p>Daily Lift was created with one purpose in mind: to make the Word of God accessible, practical, and uplifting for every believer, every single day. In a world full of noise, distractions, and pressures, God’s Word remains the one source of truth, strength, and direction. Daily Lift exists to help you pause, breathe, and reconnect with Scripture in a simple and meaningful way.</p>

  <p>My name is <strong>Stephen Njora</strong>, the founder of Daily Lift. I am 23 years old, born and raised in Kenya, and a committed believer in Jesus Christ. I serve as a discipleship teacher and peer counselor at Kingdom Seekers, Thika Road. My walk with Christ and my passion for helping people grow spiritually led me to create this platform. I have seen firsthand how a single verse or a short reflection can speak life into someone’s situation, offer clarity, or restore hope.</p>

  <p>Daily Lift is built around the idea that even a small, consistent encounter with Scripture can shape a strong spiritual foundation. Every verse, daily declaration, and short analysis is prepared with the intention of guiding believers to meditate on God’s Word, understand it better, and apply it in their daily lives.</p>

  <p>Beyond providing daily spiritual nourishment, my vision is to impact people’s lives positively in different ways, so that by God’s grace, many lives can be better than before. I aim to help people grow spiritually, emotionally, and mentally through encouragement, guidance, and practical insights from God’s Word.</p>

  <p>This website is not about complicated theology or long studies. It is about simple, steady nourishment for your spirit. Whether you are new to faith, growing in Christ, or mature in your walk, Daily Lift aims to give you something meaningful each day—something that will lift your heart, strengthen your faith, and deepen your relationship with God.</p>

  <p>My prayer is that as you journey through this platform, you will grow in understanding, find encouragement during difficult moments, and experience God’s presence in a deeper way. May Daily Lift be a blessing to you, and may the Word of God continue to be a lamp to your feet and a light to your path.</p>

  <p>Welcome to Daily Lift—where Scripture meets your everyday life, one verse at a time.</p>
